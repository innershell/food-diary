# Physician Food Diary
This web app lets physicians order a food diary requisition for a patient.  

# How it Works
1. A physician orders a food diary for his/her patient. The requisition may specify a 3, 5, or 7-day food diary.
2. The patient receives an email for the food diary and journals their diet for the prescribed number of days.
3. The patient may receive email reminders 3x per day during normal meal times as reminder.
4. The physician recieves a summary of each day with the patient's meal journal, calorie intake, and total calories during the prescribed period.
5. The physician uses this information for further patient health guidance.
